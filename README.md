# Tip-Calculator
The Tip Calculator is a simple Python program that helps users calculate the tip amount based on the cost of a meal and the desired tip percentage. This tool is especially handy for quick calculations when dining out or splitting bills.

Features:
1. Prompts the user to input:
 - The cost of the meal (e.g., $50.25).
 - The desired tip percentage (e.g., 15%).
2. Strips dollar signs ($) and percentage symbols (%) from the input for clean processing.
3. Converts the inputs to floats for mathematical calculations.
4. Calculates the tip amount and displays it formatted to two decimal places.

How to Use:
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter the cost of the meal in the format $amount (e.g., $50.25).
3. Enter the desired tip percentage in the format percentage% (e.g., 15%).
4. The program will calculate and display the tip amount.

What I Learned:
1. String manipulation with methods like .replace() for cleaning user input.
2. Basic arithmetic operations for calculations.
3. Using formatted strings (f-strings) to display results with precision.
4. Function modularity to break down tasks into smaller, reusable components.
